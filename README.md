# Frontend Mentor Challenges Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). These challenges have helped me practice and improve my skills in HTML and traditional CSS. Please note that the designs are not responsive, and I have not yet learned Flexbox or other modern layout techniques.


This version of the README reflects the fact that the designs are not responsive and that traditional CSS was used for layout, without Flexbox or Grid.


## Challenges

### 1. QR Code Component
A simple component that displays a QR code with accompanying text. This challenge allowed me to practice basic HTML structure and CSS styling, focusing on layout and typography without considering responsiveness.

### 2. Social Proof Section
A section that showcases user testimonials and ratings. This challenge helped me work on arranging elements using traditional CSS techniques, ensuring that the layout visually aligns with the design, though it is not responsive.

### 3. Social Links Profile
A profile page with social media links. This challenge involved styling links and icons using traditional CSS, focusing on achieving the correct spacing and alignment without responsive design.

### 4. Single Price Grid Component
A pricing grid component that highlights different subscription tiers. This challenge emphasized the use of traditional CSS for positioning elements within a grid-like structure, without relying on Flexbox or Grid for layout.

### 5. Huddle Landing Page with Alternating Feature
A landing page layout with sections alternating between text and images. This challenge allowed me to explore more complex layouts using traditional CSS, though the design is static and not responsive.
